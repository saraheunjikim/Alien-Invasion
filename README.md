## The Process and What I have learned

### The Process
<p>
  I started learning Python with Python Crash Course, a great book with lots of tutorials and practices.
  This is a game that you can use the arrow key and space bar to shoot aliens and win points. 
</p>


### Lesson Learned
<p>
With this game project, I learned the process of writing a program and how different parts work together to make the program running. I learned about writing different functions, using classes, and creating instances. 
</p>
<p>  
Working on this project, I encountered numerous errors that were sometimes easy to catch, such as typos and sometimes challenging to understand. I found using the Python debugger ('PDB') very helpful as I could see step by step what was going on.
